    // create a movie idea generator that will take genre, movie star, setting and title
    // It should return a value which you can console.log.

    // eg: const movieIdea = createMovie('Action', 'Meryl Streep', 'Texas', 'Drama until Dawn');
    // console.log("I have a great pitch for you. Listen to this, " + movieIdea);

    // BONUS: Have the function default to name the movie title 'Untitled'
    // BONUS: Generate a random number between 1 and 3 to see if this movie will have a sequel or be a trilogy. Add `And there will be a sequel!` if the number is 2, `And it's going to be a trilogy!` if the number is 3. Do not add anything if the number is 1.


    const createMovie = (genre, movieStar, setting, title = "untitled") => {

      const sequalMaybe = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1;
      const movieIdea = `I have the best idea, it's a ${genre} and includes ${movieStar} in ${setting} and it would be called ${title}`;

      if (sequalMaybe === 2) {
        return `${movieIdea}...And there will be a sequel!`;
      } else if (sequalMaybe === 3) {
        return `${movieIdea}....And it's going to be a trilogy!`;
      } else {
          return `${movieIdea}.`;
      }
    }

    const playMovie = createMovie('horror', 'drake', 'bombay', 'cora goes to the movies');

     console.log(`I have a great pitch for you. Listen to this, ${playMovie}`);
